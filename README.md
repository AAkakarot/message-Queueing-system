# message-Queueing-system
Message Queueing System  is a Spring-based Java application designed to provide reliable CRUD APIs for message management. It integrates with an SQL database for persistent storage and Kafka for seamless message queuing. This system ensures efficient ordering, storage, and consumption of messages, catering to real-time processing needs.

# ChronoQueue

ChronoQueue is a Spring-based message ordering system that provides CRUD APIs for managing messages. It leverages Hibernate as an ORM framework with MySQL for persistent storage and Kafka for queuing messages for asynchronous processing.

## Features

- **CRUD APIs:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on messages.
- **Hibernate ORM:** Simplifies database interactions with entity-based mapping.
- **MySQL Database:** Stores messages for long-term persistence and querying.
- **Kafka Integration:** Publishes messages to Kafka topics for later consumption.
- **Scalable Design:** Optimized for real-time processing and scalability.

## Tech Stack

- **Java 17**: Core programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building APIs.
- **Hibernate**: ORM framework for database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for persistent storage.
- **Kafka**: Message queue for asynchronous processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization support.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java 17 or later** installed on your system.
2. **Apache Kafka** setup for message queuing.
3. **MySQL Database** configured and running.
4. **Docker** (optional) for containerized deployment.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chronoqueue.git
cd chronoqueue
```

### 2. Configure the Application
Update the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file with your database and Kafka configurations:
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/chronoqueue
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
    properties:
      hibernate.dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
    topic: message-topic
```

### 3. Build and Run the Application
Use Maven to build and run the application:
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 4. API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                  |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/messages`     | Create a new message         |
| GET    | `/api/messages`     | Retrieve all messages        |
| GET    | `/api/messages/{id}`| Retrieve a message by ID     |
| PUT    | `/api/messages/{id}`| Update a message by ID       |
| DELETE | `/api/messages/{id}`| Delete a message by ID       |

### 5. Consuming Messages from Kafka
Messages published to Kafka can be consumed using Kafka consumers for real-time processing. Customize the consumer logic as needed.

## Running Tests

Run the unit tests using Maven:
```bash
mvn test
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for message filtering and querying.
- Implement a retry mechanism for Kafka consumers.
- Introduce a UI dashboard for monitoring messages.
